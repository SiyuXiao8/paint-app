# Final Project

## Building Software

Note: We are using MacOS M1 systems so building is based on that architecture.
1. Make sure you have sdl installed in your machine before running our software!
2. Download and extract the zip, or `git clone` it to your environment.
3. Within the *paint-app-server* directory of the project repository, run `dub run`.
4. Enter the IP and port information of your system to begin the server.
**This information can be found by running the getIP script located within the *paint-app-server* directory.**
5. In a separate terminal, change to the *paint-app* directory of the project repository and run `dub run`.
6. Enter the same server IP and port information to launch an SDL drawing client application.
7. For each additional client, start a new terminal and run `dub run` within the *paint-app* directory.

## The Final Project Repository!

Welcome to the final project repository!  

Here is a welcome video showing the repoisory organization--be sure to read carefully through the instructions (Consuming a large spec and breaking it down is part of engineering!).

## Team Logistics

- Work with your team to ensure everyone has a way to work on this codebase with a common set of tools.
- Everyone should make code contributions to the repository (i.e. everyone should have some commits in the commit history -- even if you pair program, that means you need to switch who is in control!)
- See the project timeline
- Note: In semesters where I have a 'token system' for late days, **you cannot use any tokens** for the final project.
